First two parameters, `pyramid_levels` and `pyramid_stop_level`, defines the size of the pyramid and at which level to stop the registration. Each level halves the resolution of the input volumes. Setting `pyramid_stop_level` to > 0 specifies that the registration should not be run on the original resolution (level 0).

`constraints_weight` sets the weight that is applied for constrained voxels. A really high value means hard constraints while a lower value may allow constraints to move a certain amount. Cost for constrained voxels are applied as constraint_weight * squared_distance, where squared_distance is the distance from the constraint target. See cost function for more info.

`landmarks_weight` sets the weight for the landmark cost term when performing
landmark-based registration.  In order to perform landmark-based registration,
a set of fixed and moving landmarks must be supplied.  The implementation of
the landmark-based unary energy term is inspired to [[1]](#1), but the cost in
each term of the sum is also proportional to the distance between the current
displacement and the landmark displacement. It is possible to limit the usage
of the landmarks up to a certain height of the resolution pyramid by assigning
to `landmarks_stop_level` a value greater than zero.

`block_size` size of the block (in voxels) for the block-wise solver. A block size of (0,0,0) will result in a single block for the whole volume.

`block_energy_epsilon`, epsilon applied when determining if a solution is good enough. Higher epsilon will result in lower run time but also lower quality.

`step_size`, this is the step size in [mm] that the solver will use.

`regularization_weight`, value between 0 and 1 used as weight for the regularization term. Cost function is specified as `cost = (1-a)*D + a*R`, where `D` is the data term, `R` is the regularization term, and `a` is the regularization weight.

`image_slots`, specifies how to use the input images. `resampler` only supports 'gaussian' for now, `normalize` specifies whether the volumes should be normalized before the registration, and `cost_function` allows to provide one or more cost functions to use. Its value can be the name of a single function ('ssd' for squared distance and 'ncc' for normalized cross correlation), in which case its weight is assumed to be `1.0`, otherwise one or multiple weighted components can be specified by listing each function and its weight.
